Remote controlled robots or unmanned ground vehicles used on missions such as bomb defusal or search and rescue will have problems with visual disturbances affecting the video feed.

VidhanceÂ® improves the video where weather conditions, smoke, vibrations, and artificial illumination etc. impair visibility, and makes it easier for the operator to reduce the risk of missing crucial details.
