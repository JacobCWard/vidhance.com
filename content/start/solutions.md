Our solutions enhance full motion video from both moving and fixed cameras in products ranging from unmanned aircrafts and ground vehicles to portable consumer devices.

# Portable Consumer Devices

The smartphone market has seen a technology race in terms of camera performance, and market leading devices are now capable of near-professional still photography. Video performance and quality were left behind in this race, but the Vidhance® software platform will enable video to make a leap in the same direction as still photography.

# Aerial Surveillance and UAS

Video from unmanned aerial systems can often be affected by disturbances such as uncontrollable movements, vibration, weather conditions, and more. The Vidhance® technology addresses this kind of issues and provides improved video to the viewer inside a ground control station or remote video terminal in real-time.

# Air Traffic Management

Air traffic control is more reliant on video than ever, and airports see more and more cameras being installed not only for traffic control, but also for security and perimeter protection purposes. However, weather and video visibility are not always favorable. Vidhance® improves the video feed received at the remote traffic control by addressing weather effects such as fog, mist, uneven illumination etc. It also provides object tracking and other video analytic functions.

# Ground Vehicles, UGVs and Robots

Remote controlled robots or unmanned ground vehicles used on missions such as bomb defusal or search and rescue will have problems with visual disturbances affecting the video feed. Vidhance® improves the video where weather conditions, smoke, vibrations, and artificial illumination etc. impair visibility, and makes it easier for the operator to reduce the risk of missing crucial details.

# Underwater and Sub-Surface Video

Remote controlled underwater robots have become an essential tool in various deep sea operations. Vidhance® can reduce the effects of uneven illumination and improve visibility in murky waters by applying contrast optimization.
