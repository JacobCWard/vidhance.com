Thesis work scheduled to be carried out in the fall of 2015.

We are looking for a skilled and bright master thesis student in software engineering, with prior experience in programming and signal processing, and with solid math skills. We appreciate dynamic, self-propelled and all-round students with good communication and social skills, who would thrive in a start-up entrepreneurial corporate culture.<!--more-->

More videos than ever before are recorded by amateurs, thanks to the proliferation of portable devices such as smartphones. However, whereas quality in consumer still photography has increased considerably, the same is not true for video clips. One remaining issue is that video clips from smartphones become too long, and they would benefit from post-production editing. However, consumers find this task too complex and time consuming, especially if done at a small handheld device.

The phone's camera, however, is a good measuring device, with the recorded video as data set. This data can be used to determine camera motion patterns and extrapolate user intent with the video clip. Imint is currently conducting research in this domain, with ongoing master thesis projects. This position will take these findings further, by using such motion data, and finding heuristic methods to automatically suggest segmentation of a recorded video clip, available to the user shortly after recording is completed.

# Job definition:

This thesis work will build on Imint's current technologies on motion estimation, and ongoing research on mapping quality metrics to motion patterns. The project will develop an algorithmic model for automatic segmentation of a video clip from a hand-held moving camera. Initial investigation into current research and industry method for the problem domain should be done.

The work will also contain building up a test data set of authentic consumer smartphone video clips, and be used for analysis of which parameters and meta data that is most suited for an algorithmic implementation. We also believe that professional video should be studied with the same model, to identify cinematic rules of thumb in film-making.

The project should be concluded with a prototype implementation, with a video file as input, and suggested edit cut points in the time domain as output.

# Qualifications:

These are requirement for this thesis work:
- Experience in C#, Java or C
- Good understanding of signal processing and its underlying mathematics
- Experience in various algorithmic modeling methods

Imint sometimes offers permanent job positions after successful thesis projects. Below are areas of general interest to Imint:

- Basic knowledge about OpenGL or DirectX, and video processing software
- Some experience in mobile phone application development or user interface development

# Terms:

The thesis work will be carried out at Imint's facility, during normal business hours.

Thesis workers will need to sign a an agreement with Imint, defining confidentiality and IP ownership terms.

The thesis work will not be remunerated as such, but a successful completion bonus of 25,000 SEK (pre-tax) will be paid for a bachelor thesis work.

# Process:

Please send your application by filling out the job application form.

We anticipate the thesis work to be completed by summer of 2015.

We welcome your application.
